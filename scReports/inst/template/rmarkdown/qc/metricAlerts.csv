This can indicate use of the wrong reference transcriptome, a reference transcriptome with overlapping genes, poor library quality, poor sequencing quality, or reads shorter than the recommended minimum. Application performance is likely to be affected."
RMT_10X_Warning,Reads Mapped Confidently to Transcriptome,10X,20,30,Warning,Low Fraction Reads Confidently Mapped To Transcriptome,"Ideal > 30%. This can indicate use of the wrong reference transcriptome, a reference transcriptome with overlapping genes, poor library quality, poor sequencing quality, or reads shorter than the recommended minimum. Application performance may be affected."
RMAG_10X_Error,Reads Mapped Antisense to Gene,10X,30,100,Error,High Fraction of Reads Mapped Antisense to Genes,Ideal < 10%. This can indicate use of an unsupported chemistry type (e.g. using Single Cell V(D)J for gene counting). Application performance is likely to be affected.
RMAG_10X_Warning,Reads Mapped Antisense to Gene,10X,10,30,Warning,High Fraction of Reads Mapped Antisense to Genes,Ideal < 10%. This can indicate use of an unsupported chemistry type (e.g. using Single Cell V(D)J for gene counting). Application performance may be affected.

#SS_Custom_Warning,Sequencing Saturation,Custom,0,50,Warning,Low Sequencing Saturation,"Depending on the biological question of interest, you may or may not need a high sequencing saturation. If the goal of the experiment is to cluster cells into populations for downstream analysis, a lower sequencing saturation may be sufficient.  A higher sequencing saturation may be necessary to detect transcripts with a low level of expression."
